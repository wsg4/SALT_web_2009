		<h1>What Is Life Teen?</h1>
			<h2>About the Program</h2>
<p>LIFE TEEN is a Catholic high school youth group that is designed to teach the Truth. Our goal is to reach out to teens on four levels: spiritual, emotional, social, and educational. We meet each Sunday at 5:15pm to celebrate the Catholic Mass, complete with contemporary music and a homily that won't leave a teen wondering how the Gospels relate to him. Afterwards, we move over to the meeting area where we have some time for fellowship over a free meal. After dinner, we move into our LifeNight which may be about a relevant issue, an educational teaching, or just about having fun in a social atmosphere. Regardless of the subject, we always aim to include teens in an interactive way. Sessions are filled with skits and music as well as time for prayer and meditation. We believe that teens are eager to hear the Truth in a fun, and open environment. The LifeNight generally begins around 6:30pm and runs until 8:30 pm.</p>

<h1>Who Is Life Teen?</h1>
<h2>About the People</h2>
<a href="images/core-full.png"><img src="images/core-thumb.png" alt="Core Team"></a>
<p>One passionate Youth Minister is great, but one person cannot minister to an entire youth group.  This is where the CORE team comes in.  CORE members are adults who choose to respond to their baptismal call by serving young people.  The LIFE TEEN Program relies heavily on the time and talents of adults within the parish community, men and women who truly care about our youth, and who are selfless enough to make sacrifices that ensure that our young people come to know God through love and truth of the Sacraments.</p><br/>

<p>One question you may ask yourself is, "Who can serve as a CORE member?"  The answer is, YOU can!  That is, if you are a faithful Catholic who is passionate about serving the youth of our parish and can commit to God, the teens, and the Life Teen Program, then you are qualified to be on CORE.  But remember, this is a ministry and not everyone is cut out to do the job we do.  If you are called, God will let you know.  It is your choice to respond to that call.</p><br/>

<p>Billy Griffith is the Director of Youth Ministry.  His CORE team consists of: Casey Coleman, Christy Fitzgerald, Michael McDonald, Rebecca Inch, and Tony and Cindy Yong.  We're always looking for more members!</p><br style="clear: left;" />
