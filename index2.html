<h2>Leading teens closer to Christ.</h2>
<p>Welcome to St. Aloysius LIFE TEEN, Hickory! The CORE team and I are
always looking for ways to improve our ministry, so don't be afraid to
ever give us feedback. Keep us in your prayers, because we want to lead
everyone to Christ in a fun and faith-filled way. We wouldn't be able to
do this without the amazing graces He dispenses!</p><br/>

<h2>Spring Retreat, March 13 - 15</h2>
	
		<img src="images/inthezone-resize.png">

<p>Join us for our 2009 Spring Retreat, "In the Zone!"  This year, St. Aloysius LifeTeen will be travelling to the <a href="http://www.brccenter.org/">Blowing Rock Conference Center</a> in Blowing Rock, NC.  Each year, we go on a faith-filled retreat to regain our focus on Christ and strengthen ourselves to the many spiritual attacks we face in every day life.  The total cost of the retreat is $75, which includes transportation, lodging, food, and other miscellaneous items we hand out for the retreat.  If you are interested, please contact Billy G by March 1 to reserve a spot!

<h2>March for Life 2009</h2>

		<img src="images/m4l-resize.png">

<p>This past January, St. Aloysius LifeTeen travelled to Washington, D.C. to protest the 1973 Supreme Court Decision of Roe v. Wade.  We joined hundreds of thousands of other pro-life protestors and peacefully marched on the Capitol.  St. Aloysius LifeTeen was also fortunate enough to meet with Congressman Patrick McHenry to encourage him to contineu with his pro-life voting record.  This year, over 80 people from St. Aloysius and St. Joseph travelled to D.C. together.

<h2>2009 Mission Trip</h2>
	
		<img src="images/knoxville.png">

<p>We are going to Knoxville, TN for our Summer 2009 Mission Trip.  We will be on Mission Trip from July 5 - 11.  The total cost of the trip is $305, but do not let the cost deter you!  We have opportunities for teens to apply for scholarships if finances are tight.  We are attending a Next Level Catholic Heart Work Camp for this year's trip.
</p>
<br style="clear:both" />
<h2>Where the bulk of the information is.</h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to attend the weekly LIFE TEEN Mass at 5:15pm.
It has great music, a great homily, and (of course) the Eucharist! We
meet every Sunday (unless otherwise announced or written in the
bulletin) after Mass for a free meal, fellowship, fun, and catechesis.</p><br style="clear: left;" /><br/><br/>
